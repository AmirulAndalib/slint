# Slint Software License, version 2.0

## Preamble

Slint is a toolkit that can be used to build user interfaces for applications.
Slint (hereafter referred to as "Software") is made available under
different licenses by SixtyFPS GmbH incorporated at Oranienburger Str. 44, 16540
Hohen Neuendorf, Germany ("SixtyFPS", "us", "we" or "our").

The "Slint Software License" is suitable for those who develop applications and
do not want to use Slint open source components under copyleft licenses.

By using the Software, You agree to be bound by this license.
**If you do not agree, do not use the Software.**

If you are accessing and using the Software on behalf of a company (such as your
employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the
authority to bind that company or other legal entity to this Agreement. In that
case, "You" and "Your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.

Each Party to this license may be referred to herein individually as a
"Party" or collectively as the "Parties".

### 1. Grant of Rights

SixtyFPS hereby grants You a world-wide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute the
Software as part of a Desktop, Web, Mobile, or Embedded System Application.

A Desktop Application is a computer program that is designed to run on a
general-purpose computer (PC or notebook), typically installed and executed
locally on the computer's operating system.

A Web Application is a computer program that is running on a server and accessed
using a web browser or client program.

A Mobile Application is a computer program that is designed to run on a mobile
phone, typically installed and executed locally on the phone's operating system.

An Embedded System Application is a computer program that is running on a computer
system designed to perform a specific task within a larger mechanical or electrical
system.

Desktop Application, Web Application, Mobile Application and Embedded System
Application are hereafter referred to as "Application".

### 2. Limitations

The license does not permit to distribute or make the Software publicly available
alone and without integration into an Application. For this purpose you may use
the Software under the GNU General Public License, version 3.

The Application may not compete with the Software.

### 3. License Conditions

The license grants are conditional provided that You do all of the following:

(a) An appropriate Pricing Plan and applicable Add-ons (such as the Embedded Add-on)
    have been purchased,

(b) You may not remove or alter any license notices (including copyright notices,
    disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the
    source code form of the Software.

### 4. Third-Party Libraries

The  Software may provide links to third-party libraries or code (collectively
"Third-Party Libraries") to implement various functions. Third-Party Libraries
do not comprise part of the Software. In some cases, access to Third-Party
Libraries may be included along with the Software delivery as a convenience for
development and testing only. You acknowledge:

(a) that some Third-Party Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright
    and/or patents from the owners of such, and

(b) that distribution of any of the Software referencing any portion of a
    Third-Party Library may require appropriate licensing from such third parties.
    All such Third-Party Libraries, along with applicable copyright notices and
    licenses, will be listed and made available to you.

### 4. Warranty and Liability

SixtyFPS is only liable for conflicting rights of third parties if SixtyFPS was aware of these rights without informing you. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, SixtyFPS provides the SOFTWARE on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, SIXTYFPS WON'T BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

### 5. Audit Rights

An independent, certified auditor on our behalf, may, upon its reasonable request, with 30 (thirty) days written notice, and at its sole expense, examine your books and records solely with respect to your use of the Licensed Software. Any such audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. Our auditor shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during an audit. If an audit reveals that you are using the Licensed Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of this Agreement, then you shall pay us reasonable costs of conducting the audit. Our auditor shall only be allowed to report violations of the terms of this Agreement, with a copy to you. You shall be provided the right to provide comments to the report before it is finalized.

### 6. Breach and Cure

If you materially breach this license, we will provide a 60 (sixty) days written notice to you during which any such breach(es) may be cured, failing which we will terminate the license.

### 7. Termination
